###### Still in a really rough draft state. Will improve as sprites are generated and optimized.



All glory to the Overminds. I play [Swarm Simulator on Kongregate](http://www.kongregate.com/games/swarmsim/swarm-simulator)

![Buzz?](http://piskel-imgstore-b.appspot.com/img/d6d6b65c-f4d7-11e4-853b-39996fd08e19.gif)
## Implementation
1. In Swarm Simulator navigate to [options > theme > `Additional Styling (advanced)`](http://i.imgur.com/cB5oMiH.png?1).
2. Paste in the __Additional CSS__ text box: `@import url('https://airpants.github.io/swarmsim-styling/_FILENAME_.css');`.
3. Hit __Apply__ and enjoy!

## Troubleshooting
1. halp I put it in and it didn't work wat do
  *  Did you use the correct URL? Make sure it's `https://`. In addition, `_FILENAME_.css` isn't actually a thing. Check it and then hit the __Apply__ button.
  *  Still not working? Right click on the frame and select __Refresh Frame__.
2. y u is so bad at code
  * Ur face is bad at code.
  * But really please tell me if I've screwed it up.
