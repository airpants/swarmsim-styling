###### Still in a really rough draft state. Will improve as sprites are generated and optimized.

All glory to the Overminds. I play [Swarm Simulator on Kongregate](http://www.kongregate.com/games/swarmsim/swarm-simulator)

## `bugskin.css`
##### Bugskin is the CSS file I'm currently building on. You can find it in the `gh-pages` branch.

## Implementation
###### how it am put pretty pictures in my game?
1. In Swarm Simulator navigate to [options > theme > `Additional Styling (advanced)`](http://i.imgur.com/cB5oMiH.png?1).
2. Paste in the __Additional CSS__ text box: `@import url('https://airpants.github.io/swarmsim-styling/bugskin.css');`.
3. Hit __Apply__ and enjoy!

## Troubleshooting
###### i pooped it up somehow
1. halp I put it in and it didn't work wat do
  *  Did you use the correct URL? Make sure it's `https://` and then hit the __Apply__ button.
  *  Still not working? Right click on the game frame and select __Refresh Frame__ to force it to reload the CSS.
2. y u is so bad at code
  * Ur face is bad at code.
  * But really please tell me if I've screwed it up. 
3. Some of the images are really bad.
  * Again, ur face. 
  * The most current draft of the sprite is always posted in the skin. If it looks like poop it's probably because I didn't get further than the rough.
